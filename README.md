## Summary
Biomedical signals representing physiological processes help advance scientific understanding of the human body as well as enable translational/therapeutic applications. This course will introduce signal processing and machine learning methods for analyzing biomedical time series.  

First, students will gain an understanding of how common biological signals such as neural activity and muscle activity are generated and the typical issues with recording them (signal dispersion, recording instabilities, data scarcity, individual variability, etc).  

Second, they will learn commonly used statistical methods used to extract useful information from these biomedical signals. Methods will span spectral analysis, unsupervised discovery & latent variable models to identify structure in data, and supervised methods to decode task-relevant information. While we focus on neurophysiological signal processing applications, the concepts are broadly applicable.

## Learning Objectives
Students will:  
- Understand the biological basis of physiological and neuro-physiological signals such as neural activity, muscle activity, cardiac signals, etc.  
- Understand challenges in physiological signal recordings such as recording drifts, non-stationarity, limited and intermittent data, individual variability, participant compliance, etc.  
- Gain knowledge about fundamental signal processing/machine learning methods used to model and understand biomedical data.  
- Gain practical experience in processing and analysing biomedical data.  
- Learn tradeoffs in data/compute complexity with different methods, and when/how to use different methods for a given problem.
